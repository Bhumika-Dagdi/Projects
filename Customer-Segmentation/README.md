# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using Clustering and PCA

This project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques. It leverages **K-Means Clustering**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, **DBSCAN**, **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**, **Agglomerative Clustering**, **DBSCAN**.
- Dimensionality reduction with **PCA** for visualization.
- **Elbow Method** to determine optimal number of clusters.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Excel-based dataset (`OnlineRetail.xlsx`)
